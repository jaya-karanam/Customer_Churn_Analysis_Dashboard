I conducted data visualization on a Bank Customer Dataset which comprised various aspects, including personal details, credit scores, churn and activity status, account balance, credit card status, and tenure details etc.

➡ The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and accessed through a CSV data connector ➡I used Power Query to conduct a series of preprocessing tasks. These tasks encompassed eliminating redundant columns, modifying datatypes, introducing new conditional columns, and arranging the data based on their indexes. ➡ I utilized the DAX language to establish key metrics, including customer count and churn rate. Subsequently, I employed diverse visual representations such as cards, slicers, gauge charts, and donut charts to effectively visualize the data. To showcase the trends in churn rate, I opted for the line and clustered column charts.

## Here are some Quick insights:

📌 The total number of customers is 10,000 with a churn rate of 20.4%

📌 Female customers are more likely to be churned than male customers

📌 The majority of inactive customers are churned

📌 While the majority of customers use credit cards, those who do not are more likely to churn

📌 Customers with less than three years or more than eight years of tenure are more likely to churn

📌 Customers between the ages of 51 and 60 are more likely to churn

📌 The Majority of customers who churned had credit scores below 400

📌 With the exception of one churned customer with an account balance between 1k and 10k, the majority of customers who churned had account balances greater than 200k
